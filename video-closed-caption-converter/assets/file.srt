1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,067
Pop-on captions,
pop on and off the screen.

2
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:06,100
They are used with programs
with multiple characters.

3
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,467
They can be
strategically placed

4
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:11,167
as to indicate to the viewer
who is speaking.

5
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,400
For example,

6
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,633
if the person
is on the left side

7
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:14,733
of the screen

8
01:00:14,733 --> 01:00:16,033
the pop-on captions
would appear

9
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:17,600
on the left side.

10
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,967
If they are
in the middle,

11
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:20,767
the caption would appear
in the middle.

12
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,333
Or, if they are on
the right side

13
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,567
of the screen

14
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,533
